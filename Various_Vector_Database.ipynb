    "\n",
    "- Open-source vector store used for storing and retrieving vector embeddings. \n",
    "- Main use is to save embeddings along with metadata to be used later by large language models.\n",
    "- Can also be used for semantic search engines over text data.\n",
    "- Offers a self-hosted server option.\n",
    "- Provides various options for storing vector embeddings.\n",
    "- Storing the vector database in-memory\n",
    "- Storing vector database in the local file system\n",
    "- Host the database on a server machine\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Working:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install Chroma for vector database.\n",
    "- Initialize the client using the database(in-memory or persistent).\n",
    "- Create a collection object using client similar to creating a table in traditional database.\n",
    "- Add text data with metadata and unique IDs.\n",
    "- Then, Chroma will automatically download the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model to convert the text into embeddings and store the in collection.\n",
    "- Ask the query in natural language, it will convert the query into embedding and use similarity search to similar results.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Client Initialization: Chroma Db can initialize and accessed through client libraries.\n",
    "- Client/Server Mode: Chroma Db can run client- server mode.\n",
    " - Collection Management: We can create and manage collections of vectors.\n",
    "- Update and delete records: We can update or remove the values from collections."
